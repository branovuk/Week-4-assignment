##Week-4-assignment - Course Project: Getting and Cleaning Data

###Introduction

This repository contains my work for the course project  "Getting and Cleaning data", part of the Data Science Specialization.

### About the files 
The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

In my repository you can find:
1. This file, README.md. This file explains all of my work and how it is connected;

2. CodeBook.md - a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data;

3. R script called run_analysis.R that does requested tasks:
    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set;
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement;
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set;
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names;
    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject;
